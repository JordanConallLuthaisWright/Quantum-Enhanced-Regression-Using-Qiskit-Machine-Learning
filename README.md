# Implementation of Quantum Support Vector Regression (QSVM) and Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) for Sinusoidal Function Approximation Using Qiskit

This project applies Qiskit Machine Learning to quantum-enhanced regression, using QSVM and QNNs to approximate a noisy sinusoidal function. It explores quantum feature maps and variational circuits to assess quantum computing’s potential in regression.

This project focuses on using **quantum computing techniques** to predict and model a **sinusoidal function** (a wave-like pattern). It specifically implements two quantum machine learning methods:  

1. **Quantum Support Vector Regression (QSVM)** – A quantum version of a classical algorithm used for making predictions.  
2. **Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)** – A neural network that uses quantum computing principles to learn patterns in data.  

The project is built using **Qiskit**, a toolkit for programming quantum computers. It explores how **quantum computing can improve regression models**, which are used to predict continuous values like trends in data.

## Project Overview
This project applies **Quantum Support Vector Regression (QSVM)** and **Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)** to approximate a **noisy sinusoidal function** using **Qiskit Machine Learning**. The goal is to assess the potential of **quantum-enhanced regression** in function approximation tasks by leveraging **quantum feature maps, variational circuits, and hybrid quantum-classical optimization**.

By encoding data into **quantum states**, optimizing variational parameters, and comparing quantum models to classical regression techniques, this project explores the **practical applications of quantum computing in predictive modeling**.
