This project focuses on using **quantum computing techniques** to predict and model a **sinusoidal function** (a wave-like pattern). It specifically implements two quantum machine learning methods:  

1. **Quantum Support Vector Regression (QSVM)** – A quantum version of a classical algorithm used for making predictions.  
2. **Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)** – A neural network that uses quantum computing principles to learn patterns in data.  

The project is built using **Qiskit**, a toolkit for programming quantum computers. It explores how **quantum computing can improve regression models**, which are used to predict continuous values like trends in data.
