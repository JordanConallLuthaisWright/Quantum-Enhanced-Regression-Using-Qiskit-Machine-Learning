# Quantum-Enhanced-Regression-Using-Qiskit-Machine-Learning
This project applies Qiskit Machine Learning to quantum-enhanced regression, using QSVM and QNNs to approximate a noisy sinusoidal function. It explores quantum feature maps and variational circuits to assess quantum computingâ€™s potential in regression.
