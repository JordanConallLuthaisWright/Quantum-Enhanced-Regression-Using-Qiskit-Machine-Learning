# Implementation of Quantum Support Vector Regression (QSVM) and Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) for Sinusoidal Function Approximation Using Qiskit

This project applies Qiskit Machine Learning to quantum-enhanced regression, using QSVM and QNNs to approximate a noisy sinusoidal function. It explores quantum feature maps and variational circuits to assess quantum computingâ€™s potential in regression.
